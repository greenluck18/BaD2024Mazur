# BaD2024Mazur

## Description
This project processes a file containing random numbers. It reads the file in chunks, processes each number to calculate the maximum, minimum, mean, and median values. Additionally, it tracks the longest increasing and decreasing sequences in the numbers. This script was developed with assistance from ChatGPT and Copilot. Information about median calculation was taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-running-integers-using-stl/
